# Azure Container Instances (ACI) Issues & Feature Tracking

## Overview

This repository was created to track features and issues for Azure Container Instances (ACI). This repository is currently monitored by the ACI product group and used to keep track of issues, feature requests/ideas, and questions from our community.

Support through issues on this repository is provided on a **best-effort basis**. For more urgent support requests, you must file a support request through official Azure support channels as urgent support is explicitly out of scope of this repository's objectives.
